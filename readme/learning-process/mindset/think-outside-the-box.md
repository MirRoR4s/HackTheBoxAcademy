欢迎来到黑客的思考方式，我们称这种思考方式为：

"**`Outside the box`**."

“跳出思维定式“

So, why didn't we think like that? During this learning path, we will acquire more information that will help us find an answer. However, first, we have to understand the way of thinking we currently use. Make it clearer. Try to understand what we have to work on.

所以，为什么我们不像上面那样思考呢？在这个学习路径期间，我们会要求更多的信息，这些信息会帮助我们找到答案。然而，首先我们必须理解我们当前使用的思考方式。更清楚地说，尝试理解我们要做什么。

**Optional Exercise:**

Why didn't you consider changing the arithmetic operations? Why didn't you think to add more digits? Try to answer as detailed as possible on your own. Try to write about it in at least 200 words.

为什么你不考虑改变算术运算符呢？为什么你不考虑添加更多数位呢？尝试尽可能具体地回答这个问题并在纸上写下你的想法，至少200词。
