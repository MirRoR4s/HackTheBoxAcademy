# Occam's Razor

Thinking outside the box helps us cross imaginary boundaries and thus to access possibilities and options that were not recognizable to us at first. Thereby, we will encounter many options, and the whole way to the solution of a problem can become very complicated very fast. The Occam's Razor principle is beneficial for simplifying these circumstances.

跳出思维定式去思考能够跨过想象力的限制，所以能够知晓到起初我们未能识别出来的可能性和选项。所以，我们会遇到很多选项，所以一个问题的全部解决方案可能会快速变得非常复杂，不过奥卡姆剃刀原理可以帮助我们简化这些情况。

Occam's Razor is one of the central principles of modern scientific theory. The principle is based on the following definition:

奥卡姆剃刀原理是现代科学理论的核心原则之一。该原理基于以下定义：

* `The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.`
* 对于同一事实状况，在几种充分可能的解释中，最直接的理论比其他所有理论更可取。换句话说:最简单的解释总是最有可能的。

For example, we can assume that our computer has stopped working. There could be many reasons for this, as we can already imagine. It can be because the power supply is faulty, CPU issues, or maybe even the motherboard is fried.

举个例子，假设我们的计算机停止了工作，这可能会是很多原因造成的。比如说能量供应出了问题，或者是CPU出了问题甚至是主板坏了。

With such or similar problems, we automatically start to list the possibilities of what could be the reason before we start to solve the problem. Many people work by the process of elimination. They eliminate the probable possibilities that could be responsible for the problem. This approach already leads us in the wrong direction and results in considerable effort to solve the problem. With this type of approach, most people would start by taking their computers apart and checking all of the connections. They are looking for the most likely cause but ignoring the simplicity factor.

带着这样的问题，在我们开始解决这个问题之前，我们可以自动地列出造成问题的原因是什么的可能性。许多人通过排除的过程来做这件事。他们会排除可能导致这个问题的可能性，但是这个方法会将我们引导到错误的方向上并让我们在求解这个问题时花费大量努力。使用这类方法，大多数人会首先把电脑拆开，检查所有的连接，他们会寻找最有可能导致问题的原因，但是忽略掉最简单的因素。

After all, the question we should be asking is:

总之，我们应该问的问题是：

* Why is our computer not getting power?
* 为什么计算机断电了？

When we ask this question, we automatically form associations in our minds that have to do with the word "power ."In this approach, the first thought is usually focused on the power supply. The power supply regulates the power for a computer. Therefore, most people's first thought is that the power supply has a defect and is no longer functional.

当我们问这个问题时，我们会自动在脑海中形成与“电源”这个词有关的联想。在这个方法中，首要的想法通常是集中在电力供应上。电力供应管理着计算机的电力，所以，大部分人首先会认为电力的供应出了问题。

Nevertheless, let us not forget to think outside the box when we think of "power ."Because if we set ourselves the limits that it can only be our computer, we limit our options considerably. If we leave these limits, the first point of contact from the computer is the connected socket and the multiple plugs. If we followed this approach, we would see that our multi-plug had been switched off; therefore, the computer had no power to start up.

然而，当我们考虑”电力供应“时，不要忘记跳出思维定式去思考。因为我们给自己设了一个限制，那就是出问题的只能是计算机本身，那这就极大限制了我们的选项。若我们摒弃这些限制，我们就可以想到可能是连接套接字和插座出了问题。若我们遵循这个方法，那么我们将会看到我们的多插头电源关闭了，所以，计算机没有电力启动。

So, in this case, the most straightforward explanation was also the most probable.



### Occam's Razor in Practice

Using Occam's Razor in theory sounds easier than it is in practice. We can state that the simplest explanation is the most probable. However, the fact is that apart from that, it is not always so. We must also distinguish between the individual details and mechanisms and the general picture or concept. In our learning phase (and thus also during our penetration tests against companies), we will encounter many situations in which we learn something new. However, it is crucial to understand the overall concept rather than the individual steps involved. For example, once we are familiar with SQL injection and how it occurs, we may find the individual steps difficult at first. However, once we understand the overall concept, it will be easy for us to discover when a web application is vulnerable to SQL injections.

If we have already dealt with SQL injections and know how they can look, we also understand that the individual steps to detect and exploit them can be very complicated. Nevertheless, what remains the same is the concept. The concept is the main focus when learning new topics.

Another example is the approach to penetration testing, which is very common throughout the cybersecurity community. Everyone discusses the cases that can occur and how best to approach them. Let us think back to Occam's Razor principle and think outside the box.

Anyone who has done at least two or three penetration tests will find that each one is unique. Even if the same systems are used for the clients and servers, their configuration is typically unique. The unique aspects are the stages in a penetration test, which we can learn more about in the [Penetration Testing Process](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/90) module.

`The simplest explanation for the best approach to penetration testing is that we work with the information we can get.`

The unique techniques of how we get and use this information are, again, individual steps followed and not the whole concept. The same applies to most exploitation attacks and the individual steps for them. Once we understand the overall picture, adapting to the given situations and conditions is much easier. However, suppose we have only learned the individual steps. In that case, we will have difficulty adapting them to new situations because we do not understand their impact on the systems and their applications.

Later in the process, we will see this phenomenon again and again. Once we have identified the solution to the problem, the process and the steps required to achieve it seem pretty straightforward in most cases. Looking back, it always seems easy once we know the solution. The art, after all, is not to get some flag but to find the way to it.
