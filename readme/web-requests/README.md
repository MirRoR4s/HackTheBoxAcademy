# Web Requests

#### Module Summary

This module introduces key fundamentals that must be mastered to be successful in information security. Understanding web requests is essential for understanding how web applications work, which is necessary before attempting to attack or secure any web application. This makes this module the very first step in web application penetration testing.

该模块介绍在信息安全方面取得成功所需的关键基础知识。理解web请求对于理解web应用程序是如何工作的起到十分重要的作用，这对于我们企图攻击或防御某web应用程序之前是十分必要的。这使得该模块成为web应用程序渗透测试学习的第一步。

This module will deliver these concepts through two main tools: `cURL` and the `Browser DevTools`. These tools are among the essential tools in any web penetration tester's arsenal, and this module will start you on the path to mastering them.

该模块主要通过两个工具阐述这些概念：cURL和浏览器开发者工具Browser DevTools。这两个工具是web渗透测试者武器库中的重要工具，该模块会帮助你开启掌握它们的道路。

In addition to the above, this module will cover:

除了上述内容之外，该模块还包括以下内容：

* An overview of the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

This module is broken down into sections with accompanying hands-on exercises to practice each of the tactics and techniques we cover. The module ends with a practical hands-on skills assessment to gauge your understanding of the various topic areas.

You can start and stop the module at any time and pick up where you left off. There is no time limit or "grading," but you must complete all of the exercises and the skills assessment to receive the maximum number of cubes and have this module marked as complete in any paths you have chosen.

As you work through the module, you will see example commands and command output for the various topics introduced. It is worth reproducing as many of these examples as possible to reinforce further the concepts presented in each section. You can do this in the `PwnBox` provided in the interactive sections or in your virtual machine.



The module is classified as "`Fundamental`" and assumes a working knowledge of the Linux command line and an understanding of information security fundamentals. Though not mandatory, we recommend taking these modules before/along with this module:

* Introduction to Networking
* Linux Fundamentals
