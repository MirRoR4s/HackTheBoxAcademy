# Modules

`Modules` are aimed at teaching you a specific topic. They contain several `Sections`, and many are `Interactive`.

`Modules` can be standalone, like the one you are currently working on, or they can be part of a `Path`, which we will outline in the next section.

You can browse available modules on the [Modules](https://academy.hackthebox.com/modules) page and start training by clicking the `Start` button on each relevant module card.

All `Modules` will require a certain amount of  `Cubes` to be unlocked. As we discussed previously, you can get more by completing `Interactive Sections` or by [choosing a subscription](https://academy.hackthebox.com/billing).



### Module Tiers

Modules are split into 5 different `Tiers`. These tiers are an easy way to group modules into distinct categories based on their cost. Notice that a high Tier doesn't necessarily equate to a high difficulty.

Tier 0 modules are `free`. There is a catch though. :) Tier 0 modules actually cost 10  cubes. However, they award the same amount by completing all questions. This is to incentivize our users to complete each module.

Tier I modules cost 50  cubes and reward back to the users 10  cubes if they complete all questions.

Tier II modules cost 100  cubes and reward back to the users 20  cubes if they complete all questions.

Tier III modules cost 500  cubes and reward back to the users 100  cubes if they complete all questions.

Tier IV modules cost 1000  cubes and reward back to the users 200  cubes if they complete all questions.



### To-Do List

You can add the modules you plan to take to your To-Do list visible in your [Dashboard](https://academy.hackthebox.com/dashboard). To add or remove a module from your To-Do list, click the heart icon located at the top right part of each module card in the [Modules](https://academy.hackthebox.com/modules) page.



### Stopping/Resuming

You can stop working with a `Module` any time by simply navigating away or closing your browser. Your progress is saved every time you mark a section as complete using the `Mark Complete and Next` button.



### Skills Assessment

Many but not all modules will have a final skills assessment (in addition to the in-module exercises) that must be taken to reach full completion and earn all cubes that the module awards. Skills assessments are performed against a separate target host. These assessments aim to test the students' knowledge of the material covered within the module sections and are designed to reinforce concepts presented in the module text. Depending on the module's size and the breadth and depth of the content, a skills assessment may require multiple steps and contain multiple questions. Other modules may have a skills assessment that only requires the student to perform a task (i.e., exploit a web application vulnerability) and submit a single flag.



### Completion

A `Module` is marked complete once all the sections are marked as completed. This includes the `Interactive` sections of the module, meaning you need to submit the correct answers.
