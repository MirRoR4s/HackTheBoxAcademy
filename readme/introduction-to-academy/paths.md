# Paths

`Paths` are sets of `Modules` that, combined, make up a broader topic.

`Paths` can be large "zero-to-hero" ones or smaller, more specialized ones targeting a specific set of topics. You can view what each path is about by expanding the `Modules` it contains.

Some `Paths` share modules, especially in the first steps of a path. This allows you to fast-forward a `Path` given that you already possess the required entry-level knowledge.

For example, imagine a scenario where you are interested in following two imaginary `Paths`:

* Active Directory Attacks and Defense
* Modern Web Attacks

Both paths would make sense to have some entry-level `Modules` to teach you the basics of Active Directory and web applications. Once you complete the first `Path`, given that the paths share the same entry-level `Modules`, you automatically save time on your second `Path` since you will start directly after the shared entry-level topics.
