# IP Addresses

Each host in the network located can be identified by the so-called `Media Access Control` address (`MAC`). This would allow data exchange within this one network. If the remote host is located in another network, knowledge of the `MAC` address is not enough to establish a connection. Addressing on the Internet is done via the `IPv4` and/or `IPv6` address, which is made up of the `network address` and the `host address`.

It does not matter whether it is a smaller network, such as a home computer network, or the entire Internet. The IP address ensures the delivery of data to the correct receiver. We can imagine the representation of `MAC` and `IPv4` / `IPv6` addresses as follows:

* `IPv4` / `IPv6` - describes the unique postal address and **district（地区）** of the receiver's building.
* `MAC` - describes the exact floor and apartment of the receiver.

It is possible for a single IP address to address multiple receivers (broadcasting) or for a device to respond to multiple IP addresses. However, it must be ensured that each IP address is assigned only once within the network.



### IPv4 Structure

The most common method of assigning IP addresses is `IPv4`, which consists of a `32`-bit binary number combined into `4 bytes` consisting of `8`-bit groups (`octets`) ranging from `0-255`. These are converted into more easily readable decimal numbers, separated by dots and represented as dotted-decimal notation.

Thus an IPv4 address can look like this:

| **Notation** | **Presentation**                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
|  Binary      | 0111 1111.0000 0000.0000 0000.0000 0001 |
| Decimal      | 127.0.0.1                               |

Each network interface (network cards, network printers, or routers) is assigned a unique IP address.

The `IPv4` format allows 4,294,967,296 unique addresses. The IP address is divided into a `host part` and a `network part`. The `router` assigns the `host part` of the IP address at home or by an administrator. The respective `network administrator` assigns the `network part`. On the Internet, this is `IANA`, which allocates and manages the unique IPs.

In the past, further classification took place here. The IP network blocks were divided into `classes A - E`. The different classes differed in the host and network shares' respective lengths.

### Subnet Mask

A further separation of these classes into small networks is done with the help of `subnetting`. This separation is done using the `netmasks`, which is as long as an IPv4 address. As with classes, it describes which bit positions within the IP address act as `network part` or `host part`.

### Network and Gateway Addresses

The `two` additional `IPs` added in the `IPs column` are reserved for the so-called `network address` and the `broadcast address`. Another important role plays the `default gateway`, which is the name for the IPv4 address of the `router` that **couples（连接）** networks and systems with different protocols and manages addresses and transmission methods. It is common for the `default gateway` to be assigned the first or last assignable IPv4 address in a subnet. This is not a technical requirement, but has become a **de-facto（**事实上**）** standard in network environments of all sizes.

### Broadcast Address

The `broadcast` IP address's task is to connect all devices in a network with each other. `Broadcast` in a network is a message that is transmitted to all participants of a network and does not require any response. In this way, a host sends a data packet to all other participants of the network simultaneously and, in doing so, communicates its `IP address`, which the receivers can use to contact it. This is the `last IPv4` address that is used for the `broadcast`.

### Binary system

The binary system is a number system that uses only two different states that are represented into two numbers (`0` and `1`) opposite to the decimal-system (0 to 9).

An IPv4 address is divided into 4 octets, as we have already seen. Each `octet` consists of `8 bits`. Each position of a bit in an octet has a specific decimal value. Let's take the following IPv4 address as an example:

* IPv4 Address: `192.168.10.39`

Here is an example of how the `first octet` looks like:

**1st Octet - Value: 192**

```
Values:         128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1
Binary:           1   1   0   0  0  0  0  0
```

If we calculate the sum of all these values for each octet where the bit is set to `1`, we get the sum:

| **Octet** | **Values**                       | **Sum** |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ------- |
| 1st       | 128 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 | = `192` |
| 2nd       | 128 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 0 | = `168` |
| 3rd       | 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0    | = `10`  |
| 4th       | 0 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 1   | = `39`  |

The entire representation from binary to decimal would look like this:

**IPv4 - Binary Notation**

```shell-session
Octet:             1st         2nd         3rd         4th
Binary:         1100 0000 . 1010 1000 . 0000 1010 . 0010 0111
Decimal:           192    .    168    .     10    .     39
```

* IPv4 Address: `192.168.10.39`

This addition takes place for each octet, which results in a decimal representation of the `IPv4 address`. The subnet mask is calculated in the same way.

**IPv4 - Decimal to Binary**

```
Values:         128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1
Binary:           1   1   1   1  1  1  1  1
```

**Subnet Mask**

```
Octet:             1st         2nd         3rd         4th
Binary:         1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 0000 0000
Decimal:           255    .    255    .    255    .     0
```

* IPv4 Address: `192.168.10.39`
* Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`

### CIDR

`Classless Inter-Domain Routing` (`CIDR`) is a method of representation and replaces the fixed assignment between IPv4 address and network classes (A, B, C, D, E). The division is based on the subnet mask or the so-called `CIDR`` `**`suffix（后缀）`**, which allows the bitwise division of the IPv4 address space and thus into `subnets` of any size. The `CIDR suffix` indicates how many bits from the beginning of the IPv4 address belong to the network. It is a notation that represents the `subnet mask` by specifying the number of `1`-bits in the subnet mask.

Let us **stick to（继续做某事）** the following IPv4 address and subnet mask as an example:

* IPv4 Address: `192.168.10.39`
* Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`

Now the whole representation of the IPv4 address and the subnet mask would look like this:

* CIDR: `192.168.10.39/24`

The CIDR suffix is, therefore, the sum of all ones in the subnet mask.

&#x20; Subnet Mask

```
Octet:             1st         2nd         3rd         4th
Binary:         1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 0000 0000 (/24)
Decimal:           255    .    255    .    255    .     0
```
